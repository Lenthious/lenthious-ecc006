<h2>Kariba Dam</h2>
<p>Halfway between the source of the Zambezi River and its mouth, lies the world's largest man-made reservoir, a safari and fishing haven - Lake Kariba</p>
<h2>How Did Kariba Get its Name?</h2>
<p>The name Kariba was derived, by the Europeans from the local Shona word 'kariva' or 'kariwa' meaning 'little trap' or 'bridge'. There are various explanations of this but one of them is that before the dam was built, the Zambezi river, at this gorge was funnelled into a narrow neck no more than 100 meters wide. The powerful water carved it's way through a large granite block, leaving the top to form a natural bridge. This arch looked like a large traditional fish trap, hence the name.</p>
<h2>Is Lake Kariba the Biggest Man-made Lake in the World?</h2>
<p>Lake Kariba, when constructed was the largest dam wall and artificial lake in the world, but although record has since been surpassed by others dams, it is still the world's largest man-made reservoir by volume, making the Zambezi River home to two world greats - the other being the largest waterfall in the world, the Victoria Falls. Kariba's reservoir volume is 185 billion m3, the surface area covers about 5500km2,  and it extends for more than 280km, with a maximum width of 40kms. It is located just about halfway between the source and mouth of the Zambezi River, and is 200kms downstream of the Victoria Falls. The lake lies on the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia, as does much of the Zambezi River.</p>
<h2>Is Lake Kariba Worth Travelling To?</h2>
<p>In our opinion... absolutely! but Lake Kariba or more correctly Kariba Dam, often gets overlooked by international tourists, possibly because it is not that well publicized or known about by foreign Travel Agents, but this is a big mistake, as it's an absolute vacationer's paradise. There is not a Zimbabwean out there who doesn't hold Kariba very close to their heart.</p>
<p>Although a bit difficult for tourists to get to, it is known for gorgeous sunsets and exciting fishing, as well as beautiful scenery, and impressive game viewing, particularly in the Matusadona National Park. The vastness of the lake allows for multi-day excursions from one end of the lake to the other in one of the many Kariba houseboats or on the Kariba Ferry. A variety of accommodation options including camping and lodges to luxury safari camps as well as the houseboats, cater for different budget groups.</p>
<p>The Zambian side does not have the same magnificence as the Zimbabwean shoreline. For one, the game is fairly non-existent on the northern bank and second, it lacks the stunning backdrop of the Matusadona mountains that the Zimbabwean side has.</p>
